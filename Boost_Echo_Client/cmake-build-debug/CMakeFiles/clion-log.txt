-- Could NOT find Boost (missing: Boost_INCLUDE_DIR) 
CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2021.1.1/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.20/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (Boost) does
  not match the name of the calling package (boost).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2021.1.1/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.20/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:2344 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package)
